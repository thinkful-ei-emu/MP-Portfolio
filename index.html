            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I will start by sharing with you a quote that I continuously try to live by, 
                <span>"Do one thing that scares you every day"</span> Eleanor Roosevelt. Starting 
                from a teacher who severely diminished my confidence in myself as a capable learner.
                I have been going through cycles of proving to myself that I am capable of overcoming 
                any task; receiving my Bachelors in Mathematics despite many classmates dropping out due
                to the difficulty, leading a team of mathematics teachers as a new teacher, developing 
                a love of indoor bouldering despite my fear of heights, this list goes on. The thing 
                is I donâ€™t ever want to stop pushing myself and proving to myself that I am capable of
                 achieving any goal.                 
            </p>
            <p>
                This brings me to my first taste of computer science, which was during my undergraduate studies. I fell instantly in love 
                with seeing assignments come to life, I was amazed that I was able to create simple programs from nothing! Then the course 
                advanced and I realized there is so much more I need to learn. I am now ready for the challenge and want to continue learning 
                more and more so that I can help create this world we live in.
